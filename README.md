### Project Insight

   A basic javascript application to test your wit against that of the specter of Harry Houndini (aka The computer)! The basis of the game is simple: With 10 tries, your goal is to guess the letter the Houdini has randomly selected before you reach 0 guesses!

### Technologies Utilized

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap

## Instructions

* The game is ready to play once the page loads!

1) Press any key to make a guess

* Guess correctly? Your score goes up! Good job.

* Run out of guesses? Houdini has won but don't fret, the game refreshes automatically. Get back out there and try your hand against the computer again!
